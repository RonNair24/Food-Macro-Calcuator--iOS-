# iOS Food Macro Calculator

Calculates macronutrients (fats,protein & carbs) based on weight entered.

Select ratios based on desired goal:

```
Calorie deficit (lose weight) - decrease carb ratio.
Calorie surplus (gain weight) - increase carb ratio & or protein ratio.
  
  
```

## Purpose

Initially created as an easy way to calculate my own macronutrient intake.
Sharing this code to help beginners, personally found the UIPickerView a-bit
confusing at first. The swift code is heavily commented to help you understand
my thought process based on my own research.
